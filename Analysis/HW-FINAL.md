## Final Assignment - A* Search From Scratch


### Relevant Method Analysis

#### Annotate the relevant methods of your auxiliary structures with cost and times for each line.
##### (Relevant means used in the A* implementation.)

#### Annotate your A* algorithm with cost and times for each line 
##### (For statements that call methods on your data structures, the costs will be those determined above.)

#### Estimate best case, worst case, and expected running times for your A* implementation.
##### (Base this on your annotations and then summarize using asymptotic notation.)
