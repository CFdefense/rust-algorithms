# CMPT 435L – Data Structures and Algorithms


---

## Course Information

This repository contains assignments and project submissions for **CMPT 435L – Data Structures and Algorithms**.  
All work in this repository reflects my solutions and understanding of course material.

## Assignments

- [x] Assignment 1: `hello_world` — basic Rust project setup / “hello world” starter.
- [x] Assignment 2: `simple_bfs` — a simple breadth-first search (BFS) traversal example.
- [x] Assignment 3: `self_balancing_bst` — self-balancing BST work (tree rotations / balancing logic).
- [x] Assignment 4: `dfs_edge_classification` — depth-first search (DFS) with edge classification.
- [x] Assignment 5: `a_star` — A\* pathfinding plus supporting custom generic data structure implementations (graph/priority queue/etc).

_(This list will be updated as assignments are completed and submitted.)_

- **Run**:

```bash
cd <subproject>
cargo run
```

- **Example**:

```bash
cd hello_world && cargo run
```
