        A* Search

        1. Define a test graph
            This graph should represent travel distances among cities or points-of-interest (real or imaginary).
            Each vertex represents a place (e.g., city, point-of-interest, etc.) and should have a name and coordinates (i.e., GPS lat. & lon.).
            Your weighting function for the graph should return the travel distance (e.g., via road) between two places.
            Note that a weight should not be computed from the coordinates - that would be straight-line distance (i.e., "as the crow flies").

        2. Implement A* Search
            Use datastructures created in data_structures/
            Your heuristic function should compute the straight-line distance between two vertices using their coordinates.
            (Don't worry about accounting for planet surface curvature, just assume a flat plane.)

        3. Main Function Will
            Creates a graph, selects a start and a goal, and then runs your A* function to determine a shortest path.
